# OrbisPro
Media center and game launcher for Windows in the style of PS4's UI.<br>
The goal of this project is to build a type of Shell replacement for Windows with the focus on gaming.<br>
This type of Shell replacement can be used on any Desktop, Laptop or Portable device that runs Windows 10 or 11 x64.<br>
Beta releases do not disable any Windows features like the Taskbar or Explorer, they're both still accessible in any case.
